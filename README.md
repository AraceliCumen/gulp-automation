## LiveReload
**LiveReload** monitors changes in your files and instantly updates all changes in your browser. It is very useful when you are updating your site and **don't want to keep manually reloading** the page in your browser again and again after every edit.

Surprisingly there seems to be lack of **simple clean working solutions** that are **easy to install, maintain and customize**. 

Many of them are based on installing a **Chrome browser extension**. However, in addition to being **limited** to the Chrome browser, [Chrome extensions are **vulnerable**](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/chrome-extensions-are-vulnerable-advantage-bad-guys/).

Other solutions are based on manually adding a script tag inside your HTML file. This adds to the **maintenance headache** to remember removing it from your production code, among others.

Both extension and extra tags are completely **unnecessary**!

## Dead simple way to enjoy LiveReload!

- Download and Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/), see [How do I get started with Node.js](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js) for more information.

- [Download this Repository](https://github.com/dmitriz/gulp-automation/archive/master.zip),
unzip it and change to the created subdirectory `gulp-automation-master`.

- **That's it!** Now start your Local Server, LiveReload and your Browser pointing to the right location with **one single command**:
```sh
npm start


## Now enjoy and read more tips in that file that loads in your browser!

Are you still here? No, we won't tell what else you see there until you do it ;-)
