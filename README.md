## LiveReload
**LiveReload** monitors changes in your files and instantly updates all changes in your browser. It is very useful when you are updating your site and **don't want to keep manually reloading** the page in your browser again and again after every edit.

Surprisingly there seems to be lack of **simple clean working solutions** that are **easy to install, maintain and customize**. 

Many of them are based on installing a **Chrome browser extension**. However, in addition to being **limited** to the Chrome browser, [Chrome extensions are **vulnerable**](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/chrome-extensions-are-vulnerable-advantage-bad-guys/).

Other solutions are based on manually adding a script tag inside your HTML file. This adds to the **maintenance headache** to remember removing it from your production code, among others.

Both extension and extra tags are completely **unnecessary**!

## Dead simple way to enjoy LiveReload!

- Download and Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/), see [How do I get started with Node.js](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js) and [Fixing npm permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions) for more information.

- Copy (clone) this repository into your local directory by typing in your terminal window:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dmitriz/gulp-automation.git
```
This should create the local subdirectory gulp-automation. Change to it:
```sh
cd gulp-automation
```

- **That's it!** Now start your Local Server and LiveReload with **one simple command**:
```sh
npm start
```
and **don't worry** when it "jumps" to your browser - we are trying hard to save you from manual work ;)

## Now enjoy and read more tips in that file that loads in your browser!
