## Dead simple way to enjoy Live Reload!

- Download and Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/download/), see [How do I get started with Node.js](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2353818/how-do-i-get-started-with-node-js) for more information.

- Install [Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/) (and be patient ;-):
```sh
npm install --global gulp
```

- Copy (clone) this repository into your local directory by typing in your terminal window:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/dmitriz/gulp-automation.git
```
This should create the local subdirectory gulp-automation. Change to it:
```sh
cd gulp-automation
```

- **That's it!** Now start your Local server and Live reload with one simple command:
```sh
gulp
```
and **don't worry** when it "jumps" to your browser - we are trying hard to save you from manual work ;)

## Now enjoy and read more tips in that file that loads in your browser!

Are you still here? No, we won't tell what else you see there until you do it ;-)
